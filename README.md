## Definition
Adapter design pattern is one of the structural design pattern and it is used so that two unrelated interfaces can work together. It is often used to make existing classes work with others without modifying their source code. The pattern involves creating an adapter class that bridges the gap between the interfaces, allowing them to communicate effectively.

## Real-World Analogy
When you travel from the US to Europe for the first time, you may get a surprise when trying to charge your laptop. The power plug and sockets standards are different in different countries. That’s why your US plug won’t fit a German socket. The problem can be solved by using a power plug adapter that has the American-style socket and the European-style plug.
